This app uses React and a few Material-UI componenets.

To run tests, run `jasmine` from CLI.

This program takes two strings as inputs and outputs two numbers, N1 and N2.
The output describes a degree of matching between the two strings:
N1 represents the number of letters in one string that each match in value and in position to a letter in the other string.
N2 represents the number of letters in one string that each match in value, but not in position to a letter in the other string.
